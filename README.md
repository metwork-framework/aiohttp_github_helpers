## What is it ?

Just a bunch of "github api" helpers for use with aiohttp. 

We use them to build bots for managing the github MetWork organization.

## What is it NOT ?

This project is not a full-featured "github api wrapper" for aiohttp. It's just a way for us to factoring code. 

So we are not really open to big changes here. It's more an internal (but public) project.
